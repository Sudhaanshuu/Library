# Library Management System

## Overview
The Library Management System is a comprehensive project designed and developed by Sudhanshu Kumar, a dedicated computer science student. This system is aimed at providing efficient management of a library's resources, including books, patrons, and transactions. The project encompasses an Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram and a relational database, ensuring data normalization and robust data management.

## Key Features
- **Book Management:** Easily add, update, and remove books from the library's collection.
- **Patron Management:** Maintain records of library patrons, their accounts, and borrowing history.
- **Transaction Management:** Facilitate the borrowing and returning of books with due date management.
- **Search and Filtering:** Efficiently search and filter books and patron records.
- **Reports and Analytics:** Generate reports to gain insights into library activities.
- **Data Security:** Ensure data integrity and security with user authentication and authorization.

## Entity-Relationship (ER) Diagram
The project includes an ER diagram that visually represents the relationships between entities, such as books, patrons, and transactions. This diagram serves as a blueprint for the underlying database structure.
